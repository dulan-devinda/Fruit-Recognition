# Fruit-Recognition CNN

## Project Overview
This project implements a fruit recognition system using CNNs. The model was trained on a large dataset with over 100 fruit classes. Various architectures and configurations were tested to improve accuracy and performance.
## Experiment 1: Initial Training with 6 Epochs

### Description
The model was initially trained for 6 epochs. The training and validation accuracy were recorded, but the model showed signs of underfitting, indicating that more epochs were needed.

### Results

## Conclusion
By experimenting with different architectures and increasing the number of epochs, the modelâ€™s accuracy improved significantly. The final model can classify over 100 types of fruits with an accuracy of 97.8%. Data augmentation and regularization techniques played a key role in improving the model's generalization.

Future improvements may include fine-tuning with pre-trained models like ResNet or EfficientNet to further boost performance.
